#BetaTester
* Based on the great plugin 'BetaTester' made by shoghicp
* This plugin allows users of the Minecraft: PE beta test to join the server running the normal version.
* They'll have to join using a different port as the current one, defaults at 19133.
* Drop it on the plugins folder and you are all set!
